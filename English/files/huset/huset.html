                            <p>
                                BO100 is located at Monbijougatan 4, a central location in Malmö, just one block away from Triangeln. The street got its name in 1889 and its current stretch from Norra Skolgatan to Folkets park in 1904.
                                <br>
                                 &emsp; &emsp;  
                                The name Monbijou comes from the innkeeper Christian Gottlieb Amilon, who gave this name to an outdoor inn in the area around 1810. The name may have been inspired by the Monbijou Palace in Berlin.
                                <br>
                                  &emsp; &emsp; 
                                At the inn, located at the corner of Spångatan/Norra Skolgatan, there was a dance floor and an amusement park. During the 1850s, it served as a cholera hospital, and in 1879, Monbijouskolan was built on the site.
                                <br>
                                &emsp; &emsp;
                                Mon Bijou is a French term meaning "my jewel". The name is fitting for the area, which has been a jewel in Malmö's history and development over the years.
                            </p>

                            <h2>A Hundred Percent Good Housing</h2>
                            <p>
                                BO100 stands for "one hundred percent good housing" and is the result of a unique collaboration between Malmö architect Ivo Waldhör and the original 39 tenants. The project was a creative idea that arose after a traditional housing fair in 1986. The Tenants' Association in Malmö had experienced that the housing fair had become more of a regular building product fair than an opportunity to present innovative ideas.
